<br />
Dr. Jana Dehovitz is a third generation physician trained at Charles University, Prague. She received her Medical Degree from a school focusing selectively on Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Shortly before graduating, dr. Dehovitz received an offer from SUNY, H.S.C., Brooklyn and after graduating she relocated to the USA as a research fellow.<br><br>
Subsequently she entered pediatric residency at St. Lukes - Roosevelt Hospital and after completion she spent several years at the Hospital for Joint Diseases specializing in perioperative care of pediatric patients.<br><br>
Ultimately she followed her dream to become a private pediatrician and joined the newly formed Tribeca Pediatrics which resulted in a partnership and opening of new locations in New York City.<br><br>
In 2008, Dr. Dehovitz decided to refocus on continuity of care and individualized approach and opened Brooklyn Heights Pediatrics where she remains as a solo physician to this day.
