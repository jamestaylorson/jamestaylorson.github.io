<p>The League is based on the scoring and rules that the Telegraph Fantasy Football employs. We use the Telegraph FF scoring system and abide by the cut-off times for submitting teams etc. However, we run our league separately from the on-line Telegraph as this allows us to work on the principle that only one manager can own any one player. Additionally, rather than sitting in front of a screen and picking a team we compete for the sole rights for a player in an auction (at the Red Lion pub), with beer aplenty and food to fuel us.</p>
<h3>RULES OVERVIEW</h3>
<h4>AUCTION</h4>
<ol>
<li>Each manager is charged with assembling a squad of 14 players (rather than a team like in the Telegraph)</li><br>
<li>The split will be as follows: 1 goalkeeper; 3 strikers; 5 midfielders, 5 defenders</li><br>
<li>The order in which we bid for players at the auction is as follows: 
<br>1) ONE goalkeeper
<br>2) THREE strikers
<br>3) FIVE midfielders
<br>4) FIVE defenders
</li><br>
<li>Only when every manager has met his quota of players (as above) will we move onto the next player group </li><br>
<li>Each manager will start the auction with a budget of 100m (a level playing field for all)</li><br>
<li>Each manager will bid, against his fellow managers, for the sole services of a player.</li><br>
<li>Increments for bidding will be a minimum of 0.5m</li><br>
<li>The lowest bid you can start with is 0.5 but you can come in much higher</li><br>
<li>The same applies to bidding increments – minimum of 0.5 but there’s nothing stopping you increasing the bid by 5m</li><br>
<li>The maximum number of players you can have from one team in your squad is THREE. Once you have hit your quota of players from one team you can no longer bid (for obvious reasons).</li><br>
<li>Similarly, once you have filled your quota of players from a player category (defenders/strikers etc) you are longer allowed to join any bidding for players from that group.</li><br>
<li>Each manager must manage their budget. Players cost a minimum of 0.5m each so make sure you allow for that when you are assembling your squad (if you need 6 player the minimum amount of cash you will need is 3m – 6 x 0.5)</li><br>

<h4>POST AUCTION</h4>

<li>Once the auction is over player values revert to what the Telegraph has listed for them. So you may have paid 25m for Salah in the auction but the player value, should you sell back to the pot, will be 7m (or whatever the Telegraph assigns to him).</li><br>
<li>Any funds left over from the 100m you started the auction with will be CREDITED to your available cash balance for the new season. During the season you will sell players to buy players so the available cash will help bridge any shortfalls. Also, if you make an offer for a player owned by another manager you may use cash from your available balance to sweeten the deal.</li><br>
<li>If a player that wasn’t on the original list of available players becomes availiable he will be offered up to all managers in the form of a sealed bid auction. Anyone submitting a bid for a player must come in at the Telegraph paper price as a minimum. As the Premiership transfer market closes a day before the season gets underway not sure if this will be put to much use but, for sake of argument, if a free agent joins a team after the auction is over then that player would be offered up to all managers via a sealed bid auction.</li><br>
<li>If you own a player no one else can own that player until such a time that you sell him back to the pot (at Telegraph prices) or you , unless you sell him (at paper value) back to the ‘pot’ or you trade/sell him to another manager.</li><br>
<li>You must always have a squad of 14. You sell a midfielder, you need to buy a midfielder.</li><br>
<li>When the season starts we generally open the transfer window every Monday and Friday, between 2pm and 4.30pm. Any manager making a purchase needs to send an email to the group notifying them of the purchase. Any player which is not already owned and part of a manager’s ‘squad’ is considered a free agent and is up for grabs at the Telegraph listed price.</li><br>
<li>Over the Xmas period due to the fixture list is all over the place and a lot of people are off means that we adopt an ‘all players score’ policy. This normally runs from around the 22nd Dec through to and including the FA Cup fixtures in the New Year, though this will ultimately be determined and advised in advance.</li><br>
<li>When submitting your team formation we follow what is allowed in the Telegraph league: 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-5-1, 3-4-3 or 5-3-2.</li><br>
<li>In a standard week the latest game of the ‘scoring’ week will conclude on a Monday night. So, in a typical game week where there are weekend fixtures and a Monday night game we would ask managers to submit their teams (via email) no later than 4.30pm on the Friday. If, however, there is a midweek game these games will be included in the gameweek. For a week where there is a Wednesday night fixture we would ask managers to submit their time by 4.30pm on Wednesday and this would be for the week including the weekend and Monday night game.</li><br>
<li>For team submissions this means that the earliest new ‘scoring week’ would be from Tuesday as this is the earliest a new scoring week would commence. We will always aim to give managers as much time to plan their strategy before submitting their team for the week.</li><br>
<li>In the event a manager forgets to submit his team (formation and subs) by the cut off (we endeavor to send out a reminder ahead of that deadline) his previous week’s formation and subs will apply.</li><br>
<li>Each manager will need to set up a group email, or modify his existing group email to include all his fellow manager contact details. This group email, as mentioned above, will be used to notify the group of any transfer activity. This is to ensure that all managers have equal opportunity to buy any player sold to the pot.</li><br>
<li>For transfers we work on a first come first served basis. However, if we receive multiple transfer requests for a player at the transfer market open we will treat these requests as all being submitted ‘at the open’ and we will invite these managers to submit sealed bids.</li><br> <h4>Auction Tips/Rules</h4>
<li>We work through each group of players in turn until every manager has met their quota. </li><br>
<li>The order we work in is: keepers; strikers; midfielders; defenders.</li><br>
<li>We start off by a manager nominating a player in the category. His nomination of that player automatically puts him in with a bid of 500k. This is the minimum increment. There is nothing stopping a manager to start the bidding off at 25m.</li><br>
<li>You can only bid on a player where: you do not already have three players from that team; you have sufficient funds to buy him (and the balance of your squad); you still need a player to meet your quota (ie five midfielders)</li><br>
</ol>

<h4>Penalties for transgressions</h4>
<p>Now, whilst we try to be fair and employ common sense it’s important that we have some rules in place. The type of mistakes I’m talking about here is when someone overspends on their allocated budget of 100m and can’t complete their purchases of players to make up their 14 player squad. Or, they buy a player when they already have the maximum quota of three players from that team etc.</p>

<p>We’ll generally put it to the vote but where possible we’ll try to cut the offender some slack. 
However, the mob rules so if the crime merits the punishment the following will apply:</p>

<h4>Overspends</h4>
<p>If a manager has insufficient funds left to purchase the balance of his players that make up his squad he will need to sell a player back to the pot.</p>

<p>This will work on a countback system. We will find the most recently purchased player whose 
auction value, if redeemed, will allow him to complete the balance of his squad.
The same applies to a situation where a manager buys a player from a team where he already has three players from that team. He will have to sell the most recently purchased player, at the auction value, back to the player list. That player will then be available to be bid on by other managers.</p><br>

<h3>Scoring Points</h3>
<p>The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible during the season. Your selected players will score points as follows:</p>
<h4>All players:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starting XI appearance (2 pts)</li>
<li>Substitute appearance (1 pt)</li>
<li>Goal scored (5 pts)</li>
<li>Key Contribution (3 pts)</li>
<li>Red card (-3 pts)</li>
<li>Yellow card (-1 pt)</li>
<li>Missed penalty (-2 pts)</li>
<li>Own Goal (-3 pts)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Goalkeepers only:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Penalty save (5pts)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Goalkeepers/defenders only:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Full Clean Sheet - player plays 60 mins or more (5 pts)</li>
<li>Part Clean Sheet - player plays fewer than 60 mins (2 pts)</li>
<li>First goal conceded (0 pts)</li>
<li>Each additional goal conceded (-1 pt)</li>
</ul>

<p>Points are not awarded for penalty shoot outs.</p>
<h4>Clean sheet bonuses:</h4>
<p>In order to earn a Full Clean Sheet bonus (5 pts), your player must complete at least 60 minutes of the match and his team must keep a clean sheet for the entire match (excluding penalty shoot-outs).</p>
<p>If a player is on the pitch for less than 60 minutes and his team keeps a clean sheet for the full match, he'll score a Part Clean Sheet bonus (2 pts).</p>
<p>All players still earn 2 points for starting a match and 1 point for coming on as a substitute. So, for example, if your goalkeeper/defender starts the match, plays an hour or more, and his team finishes the match with a clean sheet - they will score 7 points.</p>
<h4>Key Contributions (“KCs”) explained:</h4>
<p>KCs for goals will be awarded at the sole discretion of the judging panel. Up to two players may be awarded a KC for the same goal.</p>
<p>For general guidance only, the following will be considered by the judges, among other factors when deciding on KCs:</p>
<ol>
<li>no KC is given to a player who simply touches the ball sideways from a free kick, or to the penalty taker when penalties are saved or come back off the woodwork before a goal is scored</li><br>
<li>if during the build up to a goal, an opposing player significantly alters the speed or direction of the ball to the extent that it does not reach what the judges consider to be the intended target area, then no KC is given</li><br>
<li>if a goalkeeper does not have control of the ball and parries a shot or drops a cross or the ball rebounds off the woodwork, the attacking player shooting or crossing the ball may receive the KC if a goal ensues - this does not apply if the goalkeeper successfully punches the ball clear (achieving a deliberate contact on the ball)</li><br>
<li>in the event of a penalty, the player who was fouled (if applicable), may receive a KC if the resultant penalty is scored unless he takes the penalty himself in which case no KC is given</li><br>
<li>no KC is given for a player who earns a free kick that subsequently results in a goal</li><br>
<li>no KC will be awarded for a player who checks or shields another player, makes a run to create space for another player or shields the ball without touching it.</li><br>
<li>a KC may be awarded in the event of an own goal</li>
</ol>
